# LU Decomposition Tool

This repository contains a Python tool for performing LU Decomposition using Doolittle and Crout methods. The tool checks the invertibility of the matrix before decomposition by ensuring all leading principal submatrices are invertible, which is a prerequisite for LU decomposition.

## Features

- LU Decomposition using Doolittle method
- LU Decomposition using Crout method
- Matrix invertibility check for all leading principal submatrices
